# AWS ‚Üí GCP Migration Overview

This section provides the background and high-level context for our migration project from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

---

## üéØ Purpose of the Migration

We are moving from AWS to GCP to:

- **Simplify infrastructure**: replace complex AWS setups with leaner GCP services (e.g., single VM + Docker Compose for development).  
- **Reduce costs**: take advantage of GCP‚Äôs competitive pricing, sustained use discounts, and simplified architecture.  
- **Improve observability**: consolidate logging and monitoring using Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring.  
- **Enable long-term scalability**: align with Google-native services for future growth.  

---

## üìê Scope

This migration includes:

- **Compute**: EC2 ‚Üí Compute Engine (VM for dev/test, optional GKE for future scaling).  
- **Storage**: S3 ‚Üí Cloud Storage.  
- **Databases**: RDS (Postgres) ‚Üí Cloud SQL (Postgres).  
- **IAM**: AWS IAM Roles ‚Üí GCP Service Accounts.  
- **CI/CD**: CodeBuild/CodePipeline ‚Üí Cloud Build / Cloud Deploy.  
- **Networking**: Route 53 ‚Üí Cloud DNS.  

---

## üìä High-Level Architecture

### Before (AWS)
- EC2 instances managed with ALB/NLB  
- RDS for Postgres  
- S3 for object storage 
- IAM roles & secrets in Parameter Store  

### After (GCP)
- Compute Engine VM with Docker Compose for dev/test  
- Cloud SQL (Postgres)  
- Cloud Storage for objects  
- Cloud DNS & Load Balancing  
- Secrets in Secret Manager
