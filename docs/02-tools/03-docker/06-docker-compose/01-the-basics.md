# The Basics

`Docker Compose` is used for defining and running multi-container applications locally. It simplifies the setup of multiple Docker images within an environment to allow them to run and communicate with each other via a single command.

## Installation

Docker Compose is installed automatically when you install the `Docker Desktop` app. Please follow the steps in [Docker: The Basics](../../docker/01-the-basics.md) if you haven't already set up Docker Desktop.

You can check the version of Docker Compose by running the following command.

```bash
docker-compose -v
```
