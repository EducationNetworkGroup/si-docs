# Documentation Maintenance

## Regular Audits
### Schedule
- **Monthly:** Review recently changed documents for accuracy
- **Quarterly:** Full audit of high-traffic documentation
- **After Releases:** Update docs for new features and API changes
- **Project Cycle:** Comprehensive review at project handover (every 9 months)

### Project-Specific Review Cycle
Given the 9-month project duration, documentatioj should be reviewd:
- **At Project Kick-off:** Entire team reads through documentation and handover notes during first week
- **At Project Handover:** Outgoing team updates docs and handover notes, incoming team reviews them
- **Mid-Project Check:** Full team review around the 4-month mark
- **When Processes Change:** Update relevant documents immediately when workflows change

### Audit Checklist
-  Information is still accurate and relevant
-  Code examples work with current versions
-  Links are still valid
-  Screenshots match current UI
-  Contact information is up-to-date
-  Procedures reflect current workflows

## Deprecation Process
1. **Mark as Deprecated:** Add deprecation notice in document front matter
2. **Visual Indicator:** Add deprecation warning at top of document
3. **Provide Alternatives:** Link to replacement documentation
4. **Communicate Change:** Notify team of deprecated content
5. **Schedule Removal:** Remove after 3 months unless still relevant

## Versioning Strategy
- **Current Version:** Always reflect the current state in main branch
- **Archived Versions:** Keep major version docs in versioned branches
- **Migration Guides:** Provide upgrade paths between major versions
- **Version Tags:** Use semantic versioning for API documentation

## Maintenance Triggers
- **Code Changes:** When related code is modified
- **Tool Updates:** When software tools or versions change
- **Process Changes:** When team workflows are updated
- **User Feedback:** When users report issues or confusion
- **Scheduled Reviews:** Based on the audit schedule above

## Ownership
- **Primary Maintainer:** Original author or subject matter expert
- **Backup Maintainer:** Team lead or designated backup
