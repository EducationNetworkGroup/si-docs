# Documentation Maintenance

## Regular Audits

-  Links are still valid
-  Screenshots match current UI

## Deprecation Process
1. **Mark as Deprecated:** Add deprecation notice in document front matter

## Versioning Strategy
- **Current Version:** Always reflect the current state in main branch
- **Archived Versions:** Keep major version docs in versioned branches
- **Migration Guides:** Provide upgrade paths between major versions
- **Version Tags:** Use semantic versioning for API documentation

## Maintenance Triggers
- **Code Changes:** When related code is modified
- **Tool Updates:** When software tools or versions change
- **Process Changes:** When team workflows are updated
- **User Feedback:** When users report issues or confusion
- **Scheduled Reviews:** Based on the audit schedule above

## Ownership
- **Primary Maintainer:** Original author or subject matter expert
