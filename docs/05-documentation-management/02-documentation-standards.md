# Documentation Standards

## Writing Style
- **Active Voice:** Use "Configure the database" instead of "The database should be configured"
- **Concise Language:** Get straight to the point while remaining thorough
- **Consistent Terminology:** Use the same terms for the same concepts throughout all docs
- **Audience-Focused:** Write for the next team member who needs this information
- **Action-Oriented:** Use imperative mood for instructions ("Run the script" not "You should run the script")

## Document Structure
- **Start with Purpose:** Begin each document with a clear statement of what it covers
- **Logical Flow:** Organize content from basic concepts to advanced topics
- **Practical Examples:** Include real code samples and real-world scenarios
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Start simple, add complexity gradually
- **Troubleshooting:** Add common issues and solutions where relevant

## Quality Checklist
-  Document has clear introduction stating its purpose
-  All code examples are tested and functional
-  Links are valid and up-to-date
-  Screenshots are current and relevant (if used)
-  Terminology matches other documentation
-  No spelling or grammatical errors
-  Instructions are complete and actionable
