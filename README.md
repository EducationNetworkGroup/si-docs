# si-docs

Since its inception in 2014, Science Island has grown into a complex and expansive system, shaped by the contributions of over 1,000 developers. Over the years, multiple teams have worked on different aspects of the project, resulting in a rich tapestry of innovation, problem-solving, and technical evolution. The project has withstood shifting industry trends, varying development approaches, and the challenges inherent in long-term, large-scale software maintenance.

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive guide to the project’s architecture, features, conventions, and development workflow. By consolidating a decade’s worth of development into a single, structured knowledge base, this resource aims to help developers quickly onboard, navigate the system with confidence, and focus their efforts on shaping the project's future rather than deciphering its past.
